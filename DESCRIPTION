Description: 
    Provides a flexible and streamlined pipeline for formatting, analyzing, and 
    visualizing omics data, regardless of omics type (e.g. transcriptomics, proteomics, 
    metabolomics). The package includes tools for shaping input data into analysis-ready 
    structures, fitting linear or mixed-effect models, extracting key contrasts, and 
    generating a rich variety of ready-to-use publication-quality plots. 
    Designed for transparency and reproducibility across a wide range of study designs, 
    with customizable components for statistical modeling.
